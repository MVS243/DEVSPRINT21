**Description:**
- Technical Analysis of Expenditure- T.A.E., is an easy to use web-based platform for individuals to efficiently track their expenses in various categories like food, travel, personal care, skill development/ education and others. It empowers them to better analyse and manage their personal finances and recognise spending traits which otherwise would have gone overlooked.

**Functionality**
- The platform provides basic insights on how much was spent in each category, through a bar graph making it easier to compare and the actual percentage of total income it makes. The platform also displays the total expenditure and the total savings based on the values entered. Moreover, it does not collect other personal information like name or phone number, allowing the users to stay anonymous.

**Technical Aspect**
- The platform is made using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 
1. HTML: basic structure to web pages 
2. CSS: style to the platform
3. JS: implements functions to make the graph and dynamically provide numerical insights
   (makes use of plotly.js library for graph)

**Future Scope**
1. Integrate with backend to store user profiles and view trends of expenditure over extended periods of time.
2. Using Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning based models to provide better insights. (This could not be implemented currently due to lack of training dataset)
3. Adding other functionalities in the user interface and updating it regularly for better user experience.
